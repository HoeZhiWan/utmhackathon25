## Problem Statement

Buildings and infrastructure are responsible for a significant portion of energy consumption worldwide. Their inefficiencies lead to unnecessary energy waste and increased carbon emissions. Despite growing awareness of sustainability, there is a lack of practical tools that actively guide users towards sustainable energy practices.

## Our Solution

E-Tracker provides a comprehensive dashboard for:

- **Energy Monitoring**: Track real-time energy consumption across different rooms and devices
- **Solar Integration**: Monitor solar panel performance, battery status, and grid interaction
- **Cost Analysis**: View total costs, savings, and energy distribution
- **Intelligent Alerts**: Receive notifications for high consumption and potential issues
- **Optimization Suggestions**: Get actionable recommendations to reduce energy use

## Key Features

- Interactive energy flow visualization
- Solar vs. grid energy comparison
- Room-by-room consumption breakdowns
- Device-level monitoring with floor plan integration
- Performance alerts and maintenance tips
- Cost and savings tracking

## Getting Started

Clone this repository and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install

npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the dashboard.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Recharts for data visualization
- Canvas API for interactive energy flows
- Supabase for data storage and retrieval

## Project Demo

The application consists of multiple pages:
- Dashboard: Overview of energy consumption and flows
- Solar: Dedicated solar energy monitoring and performance
- Devices: Room and device-level energy monitoring
- Alerts: System alerts and maintenance suggestions

## Future Enhancements

- Machine learning for predictive energy optimization
- Mobile application for on-the-go monitoring
- Integration with smart home devices for automated control
- Expanded battery management and storage optimization
